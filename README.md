```
bin/rake db:create db:migrate
```
* Configure local development environment.
```
cp .env_example .env
```
  * The settings `.env_example` are maintained as the Gold Standard for development. The values provided therein should be enough to get any new developer up and running. Any changes for local development should be placed in the untracked `.env`.
* Start the application
```
foreman start
```
